## What I Do

### Programming
- **Python Developer**  
  I build websites using **Django**, and bots using **Telebot** with advanced architecture.
  
- **Database Mastery**  
  I work with **multiple SQLite databases** in the same Django project — splitting data logically between `db.sqlite3` and custom databases like `developers.db`.

- **Bot Systems**  
  I build Telegram bots that:
  - Load functions from external `.py` files
  - Use `callback_data` instead of commands
  - Control server projects per user
  - Handle subscriptions and block access after expiry
  - Track currently running operations in `running_files.json`

## Projects & Ideas

- **Islamic Library Website**  
  A complete Quran and Hadith platform with search and organized display using SQLite.

- **TeleBee** *(WIP)*  
  A support library for `Telebot` that lets developers:
  - Organize handlers in separate files
  - Autoload bot logic from folders
  - Avoid manual bot setup
  - Write clean modular code

- **ManageDB** *(WIP)*  
  A fully-featured wrapper for `sqlite3` that simplifies DB interaction.

- **Educational Quiz System**  
  Users solve programming or sports questions and earn points.
